# TechGenius API

This is the backend repo for the TechGenius web app being used to manage a fictional business PaperPal. This backend is built in Node.js and Express with MongoDB as database.

Check out the live site in action [HERE](https://techgenius.onrender.com/)

Check the frontend repo [here](https://github.com/servesh-chaturvedi/techGenius)

__Note:__ Due to free tier restrictions on the custom backend, it is best to visit the backend site first deployed [here](https://techgenius-api.onrender.com/) so that the login on the frontend is smooth. It takes about half a min to start. Once the site loads you can close and navigate to the frontend.


## Features

- Custom authentication implemented using JWT
- Supports CORS
- Response rate limited to 5 requests per minute
